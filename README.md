This project is about creating a database that stores data about students, teachers, classes etc. behind an appropriate GUI


This project`s aim is to create a desktop application that enables the user to manipulate data. The app could be used by small businesses for example but at the moment it is just for fun as I had the idea to create something like this. So I have a scenario so you can have an idea of what is what for:

The organisation provides security courses for those who want to work in the security business or for people who just want to learn self-defence. There are many courses to choose from and they are at different levels and types, made for specific needs. It also provides security and surveillances for various types of events such as private parties etc., marmite or aviation travel, public transportation and corporate security. Any surveillances can be arranged and will be secured by certified security and/or bodyguards.  

Requirements
•	The system should be able to store jobs/events prospective clients will book for.
•	The hour rate depends on the type of events and jobs. 
•	The system should store the types of events the organisation can provide security for.
